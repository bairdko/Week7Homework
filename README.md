# Train Scheduler
###### Assigned: 7/28/18

This was our seventh homework assigned during bootcamp. This was the first introduction to data storage of any kind, so we used firebase. This is a very simple app, just with the purpose learning how to connect to a database.

#### Mechanics
Pretty self explanatory, just enter info to add a train to the schedule.

**Known Issues:** None

**Potential Improvements:** None because this is not a useful app for any practical sense. But also -- don't use firebase!
