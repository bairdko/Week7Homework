# Train Scheduler
###### Assigned: 7/28/18

This was our seventh homework assigned during bootcamp. This was the first introduction to data storage of any kind, so we used firebase. This is a very simple app, just with the purpose learning how to connect to a database.

*Note: this will not work because the firebase connection info was removed from the repo. This project was assigned before we learned NodeJS, so we had not learned how to properly hide keys yet.*

#### Mechanics
Pretty self explanatory, just enter info to add a train to the schedule.

**Known Issues:** None

**Potential Improvements:** None because this is not a useful app for any practical sense. But also -- don't use firebase!
